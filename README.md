## Overview
This crate implements several custom future-aware `OneOf` types, which behaves
similarly to [`Either`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/future/enum.Either.html) type,
but suitable for more than two variants.

It also exposes `impl_one_of!` macro, which allows generating custom `OneOf` type,
with the desired number and names of variants

### Features

`futures_03` enables support for futures 0.3 (core/std), enabled by default

`sink` enables support for futures 0.3 (core/std)'s `Sink`, enabled by default

`tokio-io` enabled support for tokio 0.2's `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`

`futures_01` enables support for futures 0.1 under the futures_01 module

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
one-of-futures = "0.1"
```

## Example
```rust
use one_of_futures::impl_one_of;

impl_one_of!(MyEither;
  Left,
  Right
);

fn main() {
  let either = match 1 {
      0 => MyEither::Left(async { 1 }),
      _ => MyEither::Right(async { 2 }),
  };
}
```
